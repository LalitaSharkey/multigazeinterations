### About
Multi Gaze Interactions provides multi user eye tracking using common camera modules in real time. The application includes face detection, pupil detection and gaze detection libraries. Multi Gaze interactions is entirely written using Python (3.7). 


### Current Version

In the current version we use a heuristic driven approach for face, facial features and gaze detection. The source includes pretrained model using [Columbia Gaze Dataset](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/columbia_gaze/) for gaze prediction and Haar cascade filters for face and facial feature detection.
